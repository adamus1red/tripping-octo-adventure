###What is Data Protection?

<!-- Basically kids all you have to know about data protection is: don’t tell anyone anything about yourself and if you do, send them death threats and keep a hitman on speed dial (if you need a decent hitman, check the about page for my contact details and i’ll pass your information onto the guy I use). -->

The Data Protection Act is a law that protects the personal information of any person living in the United Kingdom that is stored by any company or organisatio. The company that collects and holds the information is normally referred to as the “Data Controller” while the customer who is providing the information is known as the “Data Subject”. Personal information can be any kind of data that can uniquely identify a person such as a name, an address or even a phone number. The Act was originally passed in the UK but now many other countries across have passed the same or similar laws as information can sometimes be stored across several companies. The Data Protection Act gives people the [right to:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998#Subject_rights)

View the data an organisation holds on them.
Request that incorrect information be corrected.
Require that data is not used in any way that could cause damage or distress.
Require that their data is not used for direct marketing.

If the company ignores any requests from customers relating to the rights to their information then the customer can take the company to court to have information either changed or destroyed or for financial compensation.

There are some exemptions to who can store information about people such as the government. If they believe a person is a threat to national security they have the right to collect and store information without their permission or knowledge. They also have the right to prevent the data subject from viewing or having any data amended.
