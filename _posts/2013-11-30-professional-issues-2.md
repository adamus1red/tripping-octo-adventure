FAST was the first organisation to promote the use of professional management of legitimate software, when it was formed in 1984. The organisation aims to reduce the use of software piracy in the business sectors. 

FAST is a non-profit. This means they do not make money in there day to day activities. FAST is funded by its owners, whom are a mix software developers / publishers / distributors / resellers, law firms and software asset management. 

FAST has contributed to the change of intellectual property law in the UK, its actions have seen modifications to the Copyright Act 1956, with software now being recognised as a literary work.
