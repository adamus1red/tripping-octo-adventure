In the world computer science, many laws are put into place so that computer scientists are protected from people stealing their intellectual property. Furthermore, Laws are also put into place to protect society from digital thieves trying to steal valuable passwords, banking information and data. In addition to this, some laws are also put into place so that organisations do not take advantage of personal information about customers or clients.
Data Protection Act 1998

### What the law basically does

* The Data Protection Act is a law designed to protect personal data stored on computers 


### How this affects a computer scientist

This law can affect a computer scientist in many different ways. One way in which a computer scientist can be affected is the responsibilities that he or she has when controlling the data of data subjects. The data controller must make sure that the data held within the organisational body must be kept safe and secure. This includes keeping information backed up and away from any malicious body trying to steal data. Data controllers must also make sure that the data held about individuals are kept up to date and that the information must be accurate. Data controllers must make sure that data held about an individual must be adequate, relevant and not excessive when compared to the purpose of which that information is used for. When data is collected by a legal entity, reasons for the collection of that data must be clearly described by that entity and must then be given the the Information commissioners Office.

Failure to comply with this law will lead to the ICO (information commissioners office) carrying out a full investigation on the legal entity. If the ICO deems that the legal entity has not sufficiently followed the rules within the DPA, penalty fines would then be handed out to the relevant bodies.

### Examples of Data Protection breach

In April 2011, the electronics giant 'Sony' became victim of a malicious computer hack. This led to users passwords, names, addresses, dates of birth and payment card information to be at risk of theft. This hack led to the investigation of Sony's network security, which was then followed after with a Â£250,000 fine from the ICO
