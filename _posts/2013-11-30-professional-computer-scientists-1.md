title: Role of Professional Computer Scientists
---

Professional computer scientists play an important role in modern day society in many different aspects including ethical and law. With computers playing an increasing role in the modern world, with over 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions in the world as of [2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19925506), it means that computer scientists have a vital job to keep up with the increased demand. 

Take for example mobile phones. Originally they were only able to do one task, to carry out telephone calls. However in the modern world that is only one of many tasks that can be accomplished by the phone. From playing games and organizing calendars to writing notes and viewing documents.  An increased variety of tasks gives professional computer scientists new areas to advance but also present many new problems to deal with.         

Professional bodies like the BCS have in their codes of conduct a segment that is dedicated to what it expects its members to act when it comes to the industry. For example, in the BCS code of conduct it states that its members as a duty to the profession will "seek to improve professional standards through participation in their development, use and enforcement". This gives professional computer scientists the roles that not only be helping make advances in different areas with the profession but also having a duty to make sure those advances also help to uphold and improve the current standards in use by other professionals.
