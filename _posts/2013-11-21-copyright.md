The BitTorrent protocol, designed by Bram Cohen. This protocol allows people to share data via a peer-to-peer network; this means that it is a decentralised network with no master control server to slow down the network. Due to this all downloaders are uploaders design it is very, very difficult to stop the spread of a file once it hits the BitTorrent Swarm. BitTorrent was not designed with copyright infringement in mind it was written to simply provide a highly efficient method of transferring large files over a pre-broadband internet. 

Today BitTorrent is estimated to have more users active than [Netflix and Hulu combined](http://www.fastcompany.com/1714001/bittorrent-has-more-users-netflix-and-hulu-combined-and-doubled) and uses between 3.35% to 60% (depending on source) of total [internet bandwidth usage](http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/app-usage-risk-report-visualization/#) at [9567 Petabytes a month](http://www.netnames.com/Sizing_the_piracy_universe). With several private torrent sites registering hundreds if not thousands of petabytes of data from torrents on their sites alone.

In the United Kingdom there are 21 pirate torrent sites which United Kingdom [Internet Service Providers have to block according to the High Court](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24726078) and render them inaccessible to the subscribers of their services. Some believe this could set a dangerous president for censorship of the web in the United Kingdom because none of the actual files that are being infringed upon are actually stored on the site since the sites only host the .torrent file which only has a hash of the torrent file, trackers and some basic info such as file names.

The most famous torrent site, [The Pirate Bay (TPB) famous for its legal page](http://pirateproxy.se/legal) and its resilience against the [Swedish and US governments](http://torrentfreak.com/the-piratebay-is-down-raided-by-the-swedish-police/), was the main reason the music and film industries got this blockade implemented but it is possible to assume that this has actually backfired since after the block was implemented by the major United Kingdom Internet Service Providers it's traffic from the United Kingdom increased by [12 million more visitors](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/The-Pirate-Bay-Traffic-Increase-UK-ISP-Block-Visitors-Increase,15528.html) than they would normally expect and as was recently reported by Sandvine [piracy in the EU had increased](https://www.sandvine.com/trends/global-internet-phenomena/) over the past year.
