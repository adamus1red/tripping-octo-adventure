While a lot of effort has been put into demonising BitTorrent it is actually widely used for legitimate reasons, such as distributing new versions of linux-based operating systems, Blizzard uses BitTorrent to push updates to it's games, and it is used by independent filmmakers to [distribute their work for free to a large audience](http://vodo.net).

More recently, with the large scale spread of 3D printing, the copying of physical objects has become a real worry especially since it is now possible to [3D print a working gun](http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=59NK-PF91-JC60-C0VT&csi=284355&oc=00240&perma=true). Originally the plans for the gun were made available online via BitTorrent download but due to a runnin with the US Department of Justice it was taken down but due to the distributed nature of BitTorrent the file cannot be taken down even by the uploader.

From an anonymous source I learned some stats for a fairly large BitTorrent tracker. In the past week (9 Nov 2013 - 14 Nov 2013) they've had 1'586 uploads containing 63'095 files, totaling 2.601 Terabytes in size. They have approximately 490'000 current users with 25'000 new users registering monthly and that figure is up by more than 58% per month compared to the same time last year.
