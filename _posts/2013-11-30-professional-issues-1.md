The professional body for computing in the United Kingdom is the British Computer Society, or BCS. The BCS was formed in 1957, gaining its royal charter in 1984. There are over 70,000 members of the society spread over 100 countries across the world, this means that while the society is based in the United Kingdom, it has a global reach.

The BCS's mission is to "promote wider social and economic progress through the advancement of information technology sciences and practice". It represents its members and the IT profession as a whole on issues that are relevant to society. 
The BCS talks to the government on issues which cover large IT projects, such as the NHS IT system project to privacy and piracy. This means that the BCS plays an important role in society as a whole.

The BCS is a member of both the Engineering Council UK and the Science Council. It over see's the ICT and computer science fields in the UK. 

The BCS has a code of conduct, or code of ethics, that its members must adhere to. The code is divided up in to four main sections, these are:
1.	Public interest
2.	Professional Competence and Integrity
3.	Duty to Relevant Authority
4.	Duty to the Profession
The code of conduct is there to inform and guide members of the society in issues that may be ethically or morally complicated. The full code of conduct is available on the BCS website, and can be accessed [here](http://www.bcs.org/category/6030).

One organization created by the BCS is the Federation Against Software Theft or [FAST]({{site.baseurl}}/professional-issues-2.html).

There are different types of membership of the society. These are:

1.	Affiliate: This is for people that work in fields related to the IT industry or have an interest in IT but have no experience. 
2.	Student: This is for people studying in the field of IT, and is the standard entry point of most members of the BCS.
3.	Associate: This is for people that have at least one year of IT experience. This is the other main entry point of members into the society.
4.	Professional: To be a professional member an applicant must have either five years of IT experience, or have 2-3 years experience and a relevant recognised qualification.
5.	CITP: To be a Chartered IT Professional an applicant must have 3 to 5 years and have been in a role which carries "significant responsibility, full accountability and presenting a challenging range of complex work activities."
